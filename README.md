# Breaking the Fake: A CNN-BiLSTM Approach for Fake News Detection on Social Media
Misinformation, especially during global crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, has posed significant challenges by spreading harmful and baseless claims at an unprecedented scale. Addressing this critical issue requires robust methods for distinguishing reliable information from fake news. This study presents a novel deep learning approach that leverages a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to detect misinformation with high accuracy. Using the COVID-19 Fake News dataset, comprising 8,560 tweets validated by fact-checking organizations, our proposed model achieves a remarkable 92% accuracy, surpassing traditional machine learning models and other deep learning approaches. This paper details the development of the hybrid architecture, its implementation, and a comparative analysis with existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in combating the spread of fake news on social media platforms.
